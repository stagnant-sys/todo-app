# toodoo. - The simple tasklist web application

### Introduction

This project started as an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
Along the course of the development, I found myself going outside the scope of the exercise to create a simple tasklist web application that fits my needs.

### Current features
- Create tasklists to put all your tasks into. If no tasklist is specified, the task will be put under a global 'Various tasks' tasklist ;
- Create tasks with description, deadline and priority ;
- All tasklists and tasks datas (names, descriptions, deadlines, priority) can be edited ;
- Each tasklist is displayed separately so as to keep the interface clean ;
- All tasks can be browsed by their deadline.

### Features to come
- Add option to sort tasks by deadline on tasklist details display (like it already does by default when filtering by deadline) ;
- Customize tasklists with color dots to give a more visual feedback when browsing all tasks by deadline ;
- Add local storage and network storage.

### Developed with

- Vanilla JavaScript ;
- HTML ;
- CSS (with SCSS) ;
- Webpack.
